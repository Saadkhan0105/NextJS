# NextJS

- Next.js is a React framework — it builds on top of React to make it easier and faster to create full-stack web apps (both frontend and backend together).
- It was made by a company called Vercel.

## Why do we use Next.js?
Here’s why people (and companies) love it:

	•	Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Your pages can load super fast because they are rendered on the server, not just in the browser.
	•	Static Site Generation (SSG): You can pre-build pages at build time (great for blogs, landing pages, portfolios).
	•	API Routes: You can create backend APIs in the same project — no need for a separate backend.
	•	Image Optimization: Built-in <Image /> component that makes your images load faster and better.
	•	Routing is automatic: Just add a file in the pages/ folder or the new app/ folder (App Router) — no need for react-router.
	•	SEO Friendly: Since pages are pre-rendered, Google can easily crawl and rank your website.
	•	Built-in CSS and Styling Support: You can easily use Tailwind, CSS modules, or styled-components.
	•	Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR): You can update static pages without rebuilding your whole site.
	•	Middleware and Edge Functions: Super fast serverless functions, closer to users.
